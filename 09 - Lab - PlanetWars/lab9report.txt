- tested with running the blanko and oneslowmove bots.
- made blank rando bot, does nothing as expected
- added random moves to rando bot, used it, worse than slow move as sent small packets of ships pointlessly as expected
- added best target bot with targeting non player planet with least ships with own planet most ships, wins against rando bot


-- noticed an error with the framerate adjustment, not sure why
